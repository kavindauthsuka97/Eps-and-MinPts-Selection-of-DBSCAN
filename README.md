# Eps-and-MinPts-Selection-of-DBSCAN
DBSCAN Clustering Analysis with Optimal Parameter Selection

A comprehensive implementation of DBSCAN clustering on the Iris dataset featuring automated parameter optimization through k-distance analysis. The workflow includes data preprocessing with standardization, neighborhood structure exploration using scikit-learn's NearestNeighbors, and systematic parameter tuning via k-distance plotting to determine optimal eps values.

# Key Features
1. Automated feature standardization for improved clustering performance
2. Dynamic min_samples calculation based on dataset dimensionality
3. K-distance graph generation for visual eps parameter selection
4. Distance matrix inspection utilities for cluster validation
5. Comprehensive cluster analysis with label enumeration and statistics

# Technical Implementation
1. Utilizes DBSCAN's density-based approach for robust outlier detection
2. Implements the "knee method" for optimal eps threshold identification
3. Provides diagnostic tools for cluster quality assessment
4. Supports experimental parameter adjustment and validation

Ideal for data scientists and researchers seeking a methodical approach to density-based clustering with proper parameter selection methodology.
